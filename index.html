        <p>"Very quiet place to stay - almost too quiet! The owner seemed nice enough, though a bit awkward. The shower had great water pressure. My only complaint was some strange noises from the house on the hill at night. Would probably stay again."</p>

        <p>"Decent budget option if you're passing through. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. The owner's a bit... intense about his mother though. Kept talking about her during check-in. The taxidermy in the office was a unique touch, I guess?"</p>

        <p>"Such a charming vintage motel! The young owner was so helpful with my bags. The room had this wonderful retro feel - like stepping back in time. I did suggest they fix the peephole in Room 1 though... seemed a bit suspicious."</p>

        <p>"The room was fine but what's with all the stuffed birds? And I swear I saw someone in the window of that old house, but the owner insisted his mother never comes down. Creepy vibes. Might try the Holiday Inn next time."</p>
